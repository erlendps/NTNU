## Problem 1

An embedded system is not supposed to be programmable by the end user, while a general purpose computer is meant to be programmable.

An embedded system does not cover many applications, i.e it does a few things, while a general-purpose can be used to do many things (by programming them).

An embedded system is usually part of a bigger system, and is interconnected with other parts of that system. A general purpose computer is usually the biggest and least specific part of a bigger system, i.e a general purpose computer does general things, but can for instance get data from an embedded system (which only does that).

An embedded system usually has more constraints when produced. Depending on which environment and uses it has, it has constraints on memory, size, speed and lifetime (and much more). A general purpose computer usually only cares about being fast, as it is assumed you always have a lot of memory and connected to a power unit.

Lastly the performence requirements are fixed for embedded systems, as they are known at design time. For a general purpose computer, higher performance could be useful, i.e we nearly always want to scale.

## Problem 2

It depends on which architecture we are using. If we are using ARMv7, it provides a MOV operation that allows a 16-bit immediate value, i.e integers in the range 0-(2^16 - 1). If we assume this architecture, we can indeed move 1024 using the same instruction. If however we are using Thumb-2, we have to use MOVW to move a value up to 16 bit. So it would not be able to move 1024.

## Problem 3

The first two instructions are stack instructions. We are pushing r1 and r2 onto the stack. The push operation moves the stack pointer and stores the value in the stack. Assuming that each register can hold 4 bytes.
After the first instruction is executed, the following registers are changed:
Registers:
sp: 0x3FFB

Memory:
0x3FFC-0x3FFF: 0x40

After the second instruction:
Registers:
sp: 0x3FF8

Memory:
0x3FF8-0x3FFB: 0x80

After the third instruction (store the contents of r3 in the address in sp, offset by 4 bytes):
Registers:

Memory:
0x3FFC-0x3FFF: 0x20

After the fourth instruction:
Registers:
r1: 0x80
sp: 0x3FFC

After the fifth instruction:
r2: 0x20
sp: 0x4000

## Problem 4

In polling, the CPU continously asks the device "are you ready to be read from?", i.e it is the CPU that initiates contact with the device. An interrupt is a signal that the device controller sends to the CPU stating that it is ready to be read from. Here it is the device that initiates communication. It is up to the CPU how it responds to this interrupt.

| | pros | cons |
|---|---|---|
|Polling|the cpu can read fast from the device, since it continously checks. It is therefore highly reactive|it eats up cpu time, more often than not, the device is not ready, resulting in the CPU spending millions of cycles on useless work|
|Interrupt| CPU is free to do other work, waiting for the interrupt|The interrupt has to be processed by the CPU, which can give delays (scheduling, overhead and such)|

1. Interrupt arrives.
2. CPU acks that it has received the interrupt
3. CPU saves the PC of current instructions and saves registers in that context
4. CPU jumps to the interrupt handler, which handles the interrupt.
5. CPU returns the foreground process, reinstating the saved state.

## Problem 5

The block size of the cache is 64 byte. This means that we need $log_2 \ 64 = 6$ bits for byte offset. It is a 16-way set associative cache. That means that each set has 16 cache blocks. Since each block has 64 bytes, we get $16 * 64 = 1024$ bytes per set. The cache size is 32KB, that means there are $\frac{32 KiB}{1KiB/set} = 32$ sets in the cache. We need 5 bits ($2^5 = 32$) to index these 32 sets. That means we have $32-5-6 = 21$ bits for the tag. To summarize, the tag has 21 bits, the index uses 5 bits and the offset uses 6 bits.

## Problem 6

If we want the page table to be max 1MB, but also minimizing the page size. We use 6 bits for status. Assume x is the number of bits for offset (meaning $2^x$ are the page size). Then we get $32-x$ bits for page number, meaning $2^{32-x}$ pages. Similary, the frame number is $28-x$ bits long. That means each entry is $6 + 28 - x = 34 - x$ bits.
The total size of the page table is then $2^{32-x} * (34 - x) < 2^{23}$ ($2^{23} bits are approx 1MB). Seeing this, x cannot be smaller than 10. Notice as well that $(34-x)$ will contribute with a factor between 16 and 32 (it can contribute lower, but we want a small page size). This is equivalent to $2^4$ and $2^5$ respectively. That means x is either 14 or 15. If we choose 15, we would get $2^{17} \* 19 < 1MB$. If we choose 14, we get $2^{18} \* 20 = 0.65MB$. Just to illustrate, if we choose 13, we would get $2^{19} \* 21 = 1.3MB$. So the lowest page size we can get while being under 1MB is $2^{14}=16KB$ pages

## Problem 7

```c
void set_high_earner() {
  struct employee elist[200];
  // my code starts here
  uint8_t manager_mask = 1 << 2;
  for (int = 0; i < 200; i++) {
    if (elist[i].status & manager_mask && elist[i].salary > 800000) {
      elist[i].status |= 1 << 3;
    }
  }
}
```

## Problem 8

```c
// after dead code elim (nothing changes)
int x = 30;
int y = x / 5;
y = 9 - y;
int z;
z = y * 4;
if (z > 10) {
  z = z - 10;
} else {
  z = z + 10;
}
return z * (60 / x)

// after const prop
int x = 30;
int y = 30 / 5; // set x = 30
y = 9 - y;
int z;
z = y * 4;
if (z > 10) {
  z = z - 10;
} else {
  z = z + 10;
}
return z * (60 / 30) // set x = 30

// after const fold
int x = 30;
int y = 6; // 30 / 5 = 6
y = 9 - y;
int z;
z = y * 4;
if (z > 10) {
  z = z - 10;
} else {
  z = z + 10;
}
return z * 2 // 60 / 30 = 2

// after dead code elim
// x is no longer needed
int y = 6;
y = 9 - y;
int z;
z = y * 4;
if (z > 10) {
  z = z - 10;
} else {
  z = z + 10;
}

if (z > 10) {
  z = z - 10;
} else {
  z = z + 10;
}
return z * 2

// after dead code
// dont need to set y to 3 when we reassign on next line
int y = 3;
int z;
z = y * 4;
if (z > 10) {
  z = z - 10;
} else {
  z = z + 10;
}
return z * 2

// after const prop
int y = 3;
int z;
z = 3 * 4; // y = 3
if (z > 10) {
  z = z - 10;
} else {
  z = z + 10;
}
return z * 2

// after const fold
int y = 3;
int z;
z = 12; // 3 * 4 = 12
if (z > 10) {
  z = z - 10;
} else {
  z = z + 10;
}
return z * 2

// after dead code
// y is no longer needed
int z;
z = 12;
if (z > 10) {
  z = z - 10;
} else {
  z = z + 10;
}
return z * 2

// after const prop
int z;
z = 12;
if (12 > 10) { // z = 12
  z = 12 - 10;  // z  =12
} else {
  z = 12 + 10; // z = 12
}
return z * 2

// after const fold
int z;
z = 12;
if (12 > 10) {
  z = 2;  // 12 - 10  = 2
} else {
  z = 22; // 12 + 10 = 22
}
return z * 2

// after dead code if is removed since it is always true, also assignments of z
int z = 2; // new, just assign z = 2
return z * 2

// after const prop
int z = 2;
return 2 * 2 // z = 2

// after const fold
int z = 2;
return 4  // 2 * 2 = 4

// after dead code
// dont need z anymore
return 4

// no more changes occur after this.
```

Each of the steps makes it so one can make new optimizations at the next level. This is an iterative process, and cant be done only once. For example constant propagation allows for constant folding, and the constant folding may make it so a piece of code is never used (dead), while it also allows for new propagations. It is in a sense equal to a search.

## Problem 9

a) Because we dont know when a process will become ready, meaning that a process with a short deadline could be stuck in the back of the queue in RR scheduling. When it finally is this processes turn, the deadline has already been reached. This is because RR uses a FIFO queue, there is no concept of priorities (although one might add it).

b) Running to blocked suggest that the process has yielded the proseccor, because it has to do an I/O operation. I.e it sends a I/O request.
Running to ready is caused by a timer interrupt by the processor, forcing the process to yield the processor, and dispatch another process in the ready state.

## Problem 10

Static power consumption is power lost due to our IC leaking power, because of bad insulation, short distance between drain and source and leaking into the cell body.
Dynamic power consumption is the power needed to switch e.g a CMOS from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. It is also known as power consumption while doing something useful.

CMOS use less power because the drain and source are only connected (i.e there is a current) when it is in a transition state from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0.
