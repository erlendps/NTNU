## Task 3

a) $f(n) = h(n)$. $h(n)$ is the heuristic function, and it basically says that greedy-first chooses the node with the lowest heuristic first.

b) $f(n) = h(n) + g(n)$. A* uses both the heuristic function for the given node, and the cost of getting from the start to the current node as the evaluation function.

c)

1. Expanded: 181, Eval: f(n) = 14
1. Expanded: 127B, Eval: f(n) = 9
1. Expanded: 127, Eval: f(n) = 7
1. Expanded: 127E, Eval: f(n) = 2
1. Expanded: 127D, Eval: f(n) = 0

d)

1. Expanded: 181, Eval: f(n) = 14 + 0
1. Expanded: 127B, Eval: f(n) = 9 + 8 = 17
1. Expanded: 127A, Eval: f(n) = 10 + 10 = 20
1. Expanded: 127, Eval: f(n) = 7 + 11 = 18
1. Expanded: 127E, Eval: f(n) = 2 + 18 = 20
1. Expanded: 127C, Eval: f(n) = 3 + 18 = 21
1. Expanded: 127D, Eval: f(n) = 0 + 21 = 21

e) An admissible heuristic is an heuristic that does not overestimate the actual cost from the current node to the goal. For the 8-puzzle, two admissible heuristics are the manhatten distance, and the euler distance.

f) No. Russel and Norvig allows for reexpansion of nodes, which means that the heuristic only needs to be admissible.

g)

1. constraint propagation
2. minimax
3. genetic
4. A*

## Task 4

a)

Variables = {F, T, N, ST, MR, Ã˜, SF, H, B, R, VA}
Domain = {Red, Green, Blue} (this is the same for every variable at the start)
Constraints = {F != T, T != N, N != ST}

c) Discrete finite domain. Linear and binary constraints.

f) MRV and D should be used for choosing the next region to color next. LCV is used to decide the order of examined values.
