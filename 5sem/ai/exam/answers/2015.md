# Exam 2015

## Task 1

a) False F
b) True T
c) True T
d) False F
e) True T
f) True F
g) True T
h) False T
i) True F
j) True T

## Task 2

a) C D
b) B B
c) G G
d) C C
e) B D

## Task 3

a) Yes
b) No, what we are saying here is that if x is a mammal and not a whale, then y (which could be anything) is a mammal, a human and is similar to x.
c) No it cannot. The first sentence will be converted to $\neg A \vee B \vee C$, which is not possible to convert to a horn clause. Same goes for the second and fourth sentence. The third can be.
The third is just itslef
d)
$A \implies (B \vee C)$
$\equiv \neg A \vee B \vee C$

$\neg A \implies (B \vee C)$
$\equiv A \vee B \vee C$

$\neg C$

$(B \vee D) \implies E$
$(\neg B \wedge \neg D) \vee E$
$(B \vee E) \wedge (D \vee E)$

The set is {$\neg A \vee B \vee C$, $A \vee B \vee C$, $\neg C$, $(B \vee E) \wedge (D \vee E)$}

e) No, this is not correct since y lives in the scope of the universal quantifiable variable x. What we are saying now is that for each person x, they have the same heart H1. What we want to do instead is to make it a function that depends on x, so that each person gets a unique heart.

f) 

## Task 4

a) For label 1:
$(W(a) \wedge \neg W(b) \wedge) \vee (\neg W(a) \wedge W(b))$

For label 2:
$$
(W(a) \wedge W(b) \wedge \neg W(c)) \vee \\
(W(a) \wedge \neg W(b) \wedge W(c)) \vee \\
(\neg W(a) \wedge W(b) \wedge W(c))
$$

b) We then have a complete representation:
$\neg W(a) \wedge W(b) \wedge W(c)$

## Task 6

a) A
b) 
c) E
d) C
e) C

## Task 7

a) A-B-E-J-C-D-F-I-H note here that it uses early-goal test.
b) A-E-I-H
c) A-B-E-I-H
d) A-E-I-H

## Task 8

a and b)

A = 4
B = 4
C = 2
D = 5
E = 4
F = 7
H = 8
I = 2
L = 4
M = 2

c)
W, O, P, Q, R, S
